In 2012 alone, 7 million deaths in the world were attributable to the combined effects of ambient (3.7
million) and household (4.3 million) air pollution (WHO, 2015). Figure 3 shows the leading causes of
deaths and premature deaths in the world (as of 2010). Ischemic heart disease is at the forefront in this
ranking of causes, and COPD, lower respiratory infections, lung cancer are also amongst the top five
causes of deaths worldwide. As part of an update on the
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2010, it was found that essentially five different kinds of
respiratory health conditions are the causes behind the number of deaths. About 36% of the deaths are
said to be attributable to Ischaemic Heart Disease (IHD), 33% to stroke, 17% to Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease (COPD), 8% to Acute Lower Respiratory Disease (ALRI) and 6% to lung cancer. The
update also quantifies the effect on people from different gender and age groups. According to it, 49%
of the 7 million in 2012 were men (aged 25 years or above), 42% were women (aged 25 years or above)
and 9% were children (under the age of 5 years) (WHO, 2014). Deaths in Western Pacific low and middle
income region is the highest in the world, followed by South-East Asia and then by Africa. 
As per the data
observations, it can be said that the total global deaths due to all the major respiratory diseases seem to
be reducing systematically for the time period in consideration. This is also due to the improvements
made over these years, 1990 to 2010, in the quality, accessibility and availability of health services and
medicines, that are being provided to the geographical areas where treatment from the illnesses are
required. There is insufficient data to be able to state that the percentage of total global deaths that are
attributed to air pollution have reduced over these years due to improvements in global air quality, if
any.
