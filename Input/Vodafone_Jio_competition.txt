Not very long ago, India had a booming telecom industry, with a dozen operators battling for market share in this 
billion user market.But three years ago, Reliance Jio entered the sector which rock-bottom tariffs. A brutal tariff 
war started, which kicked several operators out of the race to provide wireless services and left many with battle scars. 
Today, just two other private operators, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea are left to compete with Jio.
Earlier this week, Jio overtook rival Bharti Airtel to become the country’s second largest operator in terms of 
mobile phone subscribers.
Vodafone Idea retains top spot in terms of subscriber base. But if you compare India’s number one and 
number two players on metrics like profitability, revenue, 4G data users and the growth trend of the operators’ 
average revenue per user, the results that emerge boggle the mind.
