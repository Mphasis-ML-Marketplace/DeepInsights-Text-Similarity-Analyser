Air pollution is linked with diseases and infections that kill around
600,000 children under 5 years of age per year.1
 Pneumonia
accounts for up to 16 per cent of all under-five deaths;2
 more
than half of childhood pneumonia deaths are associated with air
pollution.3
Globally, according to the World Health Organization indoor air
pollution killed about 4.3 million people and outdoor air pollution
killed about 3.7 million in 2012.4,5 Focussing on under-5 mortality,
the World Health Organization found that approximately 531,000
children under the age of 5 died from household air pollution in
2012, and around 127,000 children under the age of 5 died from
outdoor air pollution in 2012.
A 2016 comparative risk assessment of the Global Burden of
Disease 2015 study found similar estimates. It found that air
pollution exposure was linked with almost 6.5 million deaths
worldwide (ranging from 5.7–7.3 million), with 4.2 million due to
outdoor air pollution (ranging from 3.7–4.8 million), and just under 2.9 million due to indoor air pollution (ranging from 2.2–3.6
million). For outdoor air pollution, this represents a considerable
increase compared to 2013 estimates, when it was linked with
2.9 million deaths. The number of indoor air pollution deaths
remained largely the same between both 2013 and 2015 studies.
