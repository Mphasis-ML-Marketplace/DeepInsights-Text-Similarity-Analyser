Air pollution is a major concern of new civilized world, which has a serious toxicological impact on human health 
and the environment. It has a number of different emission sources, but motor vehicles and industrial processes 
contribute the major part of air pollution. According to the World Health Organization, six major air pollutants 
include particle pollution, ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead. Long 
and short term exposure to air suspended toxicants has a different toxicological impact on human including respiratory
and cardiovascular diseases, neuropsychiatric complications, the eyes irritation, skin diseases, and long-term chronic
diseases such as cancer. Several reports have revealed the direct association between exposure to the poor air quality
and increasing rate of morbidity and mortality mostly due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Air pollution 
is considered as the major environmental risk factor in the incidence and progression of some diseases such as asthma,
lung cancer, ventricular hypertrophy, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, psychological complications, autism, 
retinopathy, fetal growth, and low birth weight. In this review article, we aimed to discuss toxicology of major 
air pollutants, sources of emission, and their impact on human health. We have also proposed practical measures to 
reduce air pollution in Iran.
