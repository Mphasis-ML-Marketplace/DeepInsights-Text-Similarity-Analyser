Air pollution is responsible for an estimated 7
million deaths annually, or one in eight
premature deaths every year. This makes it the
world’s largest environmental health risk, and
among the largest global health risks –
comparable with “traditional” health risks such as
smoking, high cholesterol, high blood sugar and
obesity.
Some 4.3 million air pollution-related deaths are
due to household air pollution and 3.7 million
deaths are due to outdoor air pollution. Most air
pollution-related deaths are from heart disease
and stroke, followed by chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, acute and chronic respiratory
conditions and cancers.
The air pollutant linked most closely to excess
death and disease is PM2.5 (particulate matter less
than 2.5 micrometres in diameter), heavily emitted
by both diesel vehicles and the combustion of
biomass, coal and kerosene. Ozone is another
pollutant that causes significant respiratory illness,
including chronic asthma. There is growing evidence that oxides of nitrogen (NOx), a
major contributor to ozone and heavily emitted by diesel vehicles, is also linked to
significant health risks
