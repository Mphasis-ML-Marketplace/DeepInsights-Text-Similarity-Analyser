Numerous studies have found an association between air pollution and several adverse
health effects in the general population. These effects range from subclinical effects
to premature death, and include notably the following consequences:
Increased respiratory ailments (bronchiolitis, rhinopharyngitis, bronchial hypersecretions);
Degradated ventilator function (lower breathing capacity, asthma, coughing);
Eye irritation;
Increased cardiovascular morbidity;
Depleted immune system;
Impact on short-term mortality due to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases;
Impact on long-term mortality linked to the carcinogenic effect of pollutants.
Air pollution is a major cause of non-communicable diseases. It is estimated that at
least 3% of cardiopulmonary and 5% of lung cancer deaths are attributable to PM
globally. The most recent study on the Global Burden of Disease estimates that 7.5%
of deaths globally were attributable to ambient air pollution in 2016. In the same year,
27.5% of deaths due to Lower Respiratory Tract Infections and 26.8% of deaths due to
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases were linked to air pollution. This chapter will
review the impact of air pollution on the major sources of deaths globally
