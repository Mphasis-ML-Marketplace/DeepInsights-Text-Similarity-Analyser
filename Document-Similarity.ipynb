      "The Supreme Court recently quashed the review petition filed by incumbent operators Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel on the AGR (adjusted gross revenues) dues. The apex court's October judgement has affected 15 telcos but only five of them are operational right now. Out of these five, nearly 60 per cent (of Rs 1.47 lakh crore) is due on incumbents. As per reports, these telcos would likely seek an extension of the payment deadline (January 23) or file a curative petition with the court. Under such petition, the petitioner will have to prove that the court's decision would have a humanitarian impact and severe repercussions on GDP. A curative petition is reviewed by the three senior-most judges of the Supreme Court, alongside the judges who passed the original judgement. Given that the past success of such petitions is low, telcos like Vodafone Idea who neither have cash to pay up dues (Rs 53,038.6 crore) nor the backing of promoters - Aditya Birla Group and Vodafone Plc - to infuse fresh capital, the chances of it going under seem highly likely. In an interview in December 2019, Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman of Vodafone Idea, had said that in the absence of any relief on the AGR case, \"it does not make sense to put good money after bad. That would be end of story for us. We will shut shop.\"Financial services firm Jefferies said, in a report,that Vodafone Idea is on a sticky wicket. \"The best case for lenders is VIL survives long enough and repays the loans back. It all depends on whether India is okay with a two-player market,\" the 16 January report said. The result of Vodafone Idea facing a shutdown may result in billions of debt default, large-scale job losses and subscriber churn. The biggest losers are going to be government and banks.   \n"
